      "content": "The **Paderborn University (PU) Bearing Dataset** remains one of the most comprehensive and widely used datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, particularly due to its inclusion of **both vibration and motor current signals** under controlled, real-world-like conditions. While newer datasets have emerged, the PU dataset continues to set a benchmark for multi-sensor, multi-condition data collection.\n\nRecent advancements have led to the development of **industrial-scale datasets** such as the **SCA Bearing Dataset** (Mittuniversitetet, 2024) and **MAFAULDA** (UFRJ, ~2018), which focus on **real-world, natural faults** in industrial environments—addressing a key limitation of lab-based datasets like CWRU or PU. These datasets are valuable for testing **domain adaptation** and **transfer learning**, as they reflect actual operational variability, including noise, load fluctuations, and non-stationary conditions.\n\nAnother notable development is the **FEMTO-ST PRONOSTIA** and **NASA IMS** datasets, which emphasize **prognostics** (remaining useful life prediction) rather than just diagnosis. These are crucial for predictive maintenance applications and include long-term degradation data under accelerated life testing.\n\nHowever, for **diagnosis under diverse operating conditions**, the **PU dataset still stands out** due to its:\n- 32 distinct fault states (14 real, 12 artificial, 6 healthy),\n- 4 operating conditions (varying speed, load, torque),\n- High sampling rate (64 kHz),\n- Synchronized motor current and vibration data,\n- Detailed metadata (temperature, load, speed).\n\nNewer datasets like **JNU** and **Politecnico di Torino** add multi-sensor fusion (e.g., temperature, speed), enhancing realism. Yet, the PU dataset’s **combination of artificial and real damage**, **multi-sensor synchronization**, and **reproducible experimental setup** makes it uniquely suited for training and validating **AI-driven, robust fault diagnosis models**, especially in **non-stationary or unknown operating conditions**.\n\nThus, while newer datasets offer industrial relevance and prognostic capabilities, the **PU dataset remains a gold standard** for diagnosis research, particularly when combined with modern deep learning and domain adaptation techniques."
